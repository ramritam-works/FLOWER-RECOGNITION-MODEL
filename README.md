# FLOWER-RECOGNITION-MODEL
A beginner friendly ML project made by me using Python and Streamlit

Things to do after downloading the code:
  1. Download any data set from online sources (mine one is this https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imsparsh/flowers-dataset)
  2. Make sure to rename the files in the code according to "your" file names
  3. Also make sure to create a "upload" folder or the code will not work

I know most of you will be doing this project for college purpose and if you have any doubt make sure to reach me through my email "sarkar.ramritam@gmail.com"
